# Connect_Three
It is the same infamous game of connecting n number of dots first in order to win the game. Here I have kept the value of n to be 3.
This web page is completely based on Frontend techs and requires no backend. 
The javascript part mainly compromises of Jquery and alternative js approach to make this game would be the use of array.

I hope you will enjoy this easy to play and make game.
Thank You.
